AceNote is a customized personal note system. It has the same feature as other note system. The difference is you can control and manage your note and push it to remote repository for version control. Also, you can get a card review system base on note system now to help you better memory what you want

## Why AceNote
Actually, I have used note system for two years. I find they almost are perfect where they are good at, like notes storage, classify, tag management, note export etc. But I found some  pain point for me when I have used note system.
AceNote has the following feature:
* You can manage your note at local and take a version control
* You can build your personal review queue when you want to periodic review your note
* Commonly visualization management(todos)
* Goal/plan management(todos)
* Personal time tracking(todos)
